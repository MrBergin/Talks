package mr.bergin.talks.a_generic_talk_on_kotlin.a_intro

/**
 * The intended audience:
 * This talk is intended for anyone who's interested in Kotlin's Generics, of course!
 * That being said, it is assumed the audience is already familiar with programming, exposure to generics
 * in any language will also help!
 */

/**
 * The intended outcome:
 * The audience should come away with a better understanding of how to use kotlin's generics to produce code which is:
 *
 * Easy to read (reduced boilerplate and duplication).
 * Clear intent (the intent of the piece of code should be clear, minimal WTFs per minute)
 * Easy to navigate (write code to help code-completion help others find relevant functions)
 * Flexible (code shouldn't restrict us unless there is a worthwhile trade-off for it)
 *
 * Where applicable the sections of this talk will reflect on how it relates to the above points.
 */

/**
 * The talk is split up into two sections: fundamentals and tangents.
 *
 * Fundamentals will cover syntax/keywords/concepts, this includes concepts you may already be aware of but these
 * explanations are to ensure we're all on the same page when it comes to the next section.
 *
 * Tangents is the more interesting section where we will explore the other wonderful features of Kotlin and how, when
 * combined with generics, we can achieve code which meets the criteria outlined above.
 */

/**
 * A warning on idiomatic kotlin:
 *
 * In the interest of not introducing too many concepts too quickly the code examples may not represent idiomatic Kotlin
 * until later on in the talk.
 *
 * Some examples in this talk generate errors, warnings and suggestions from the compiler, this is intentional!
