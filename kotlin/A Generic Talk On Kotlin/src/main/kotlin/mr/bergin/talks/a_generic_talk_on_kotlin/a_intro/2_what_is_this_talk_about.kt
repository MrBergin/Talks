package mr.bergin.talks.a_generic_talk_on_kotlin.a_intro

/**
 * The intended audience:
 * This talk is intended for anyone who's interested in Kotlin's Generics, of course!
 * That being said, it is assumed the audience is already familiar with programming, exposure to generics
 * in another language will also help!
 *
 * The intended outcome:
 * The audience should come away with a better understanding of how to use kotlin's generics to produce code which is:
 * Easy to read (reduced boilerplate and duplication).
 * Easy to understand (the intent of the piece of code should be clear)
 * Easy to navigate (write code to enable code-completion to find relevant functions)
 * Flexible (APIs shouldn't restrict the programmer where possible)
 *
 * In the interest of not introducing too many concepts too quicklythe  code examples may not represent idiomatic Kotlin
 * until later on in the talk.
