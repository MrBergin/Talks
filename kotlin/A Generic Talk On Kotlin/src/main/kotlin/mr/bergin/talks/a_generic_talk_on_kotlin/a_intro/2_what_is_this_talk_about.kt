package mr.bergin.talks.a_generic_talk_on_kotlin.a_intro

/**
 * This talk is intended for people with experience in development already.
 *
 * It is assumed the audience is familiar with generics as a concept, perhaps by using them in another language.
 *
 * The intent is for the developer to come away with a better understanding of how they can write code
 * with less boiler plate, duplication, with a clearer intent and even better auto-completion from their IDE.
 *
 * Many examples shown here will not necessarily be idiomatic kotlin until toward the end of the talk. By this point
 * we will combine generics with other features of kotlin to ascend to the land of idiomatic.
