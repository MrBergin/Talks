# A Generic Talk On Kotlin.

## Summary
This project holds files used to deliver a talk on Kotlin's generics, focusing on how they can be used to write
clean, well structured flexible code. Aside from some of the introductory content the talk is written in a way
that anyone could deliver.

## Sections
This talk is divided into three sections:

### 1) Introduction
This section is to break the talk in, there is some content on generic examples, but mostly it's to describe
the speaker and who the talk is aimed at.

### 2) Fundamentals
This section covers an explanation of concepts and syntax, along with examples and an explanation of why they are useful
to have.

### 3) Tangents
Here we describe different parts of Kotlin and how they interact with generics to achieve the clean, well structured
flexible code the talk promises to demonstrate.

## Places this talk has been done

### At the Edinburgh Kotlin Usergroup held on the 5th September 2019.
